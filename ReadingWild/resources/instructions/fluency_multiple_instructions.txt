Next, you are going to solve some more category puzzles, but this time, there are a lot of categories available, and you can switch from category to category. The goal is to say as many examples from each category as you can within a time limit. Just as in the last task you will receive one point for every example you say. 

You will see one category at a time. Stay with that category for as long as you want, and when you are ready to go to a new one, press the arrow button (â†’) to go to a new one. Once you see a category, please say the examples from this category loudly. Once you leave a category, you will not be able to go back. Some may be easier than others. Words from the different categories are all worth one point, and your goal is to earn as many points as possible across all the categories. 

When you are ready to start, please press Start.
