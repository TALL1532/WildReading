Next, you are going to solve some more word search puzzles, but this time, there are a lot of puzzles available, and you can switch from puzzle to puzzle.. The goal is to find as many words as you can from these puzzles within a time limit. Just as in the last task, you will receive one point for every word you find and there is a counter that will show you how many words you have accumulated.
 
 You will see one puzzle at a time. Work on that puzzle for as long as you want, and when you are ready to go to a new one, press the arrow button (→) to go to a new puzzle. Once you leave a puzzle, you will not be able to go back. Some puzzles may be easier than others. Words from the different puzzles are all worth one point, and your goal is to earn as many points as possible across all the puzzles.
